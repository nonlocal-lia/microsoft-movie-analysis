    "Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but they lack experience in this market. There are many difficult problems facing new studios entering the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid in this endeavor we will give recommendations to help address three core problems that any studio will have to answer in the course of making a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determining what type of project to pursue.\n",
    "* Determining what talent should be hired.\n",
    "* Determining the timeline of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help answer elements of these problems we will investigate the answers to three related questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What genre has had the high average profit in the past 20 years?\n",
    "* What directors have had the highest average return in that genre?\n",
    "* What month of the year is good to release a major film?\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking a genre is necessary to give an initial outline to the projects, and hiring a director is a good way of determining what other talent is appropriate since they can bring their expertise to help answer lower level talent decisions."

What script sould the movie use and should it be connected to other Microsoft media projects, which has potential rewards in increased sales in other areas such as video games, but also risks in damaging the brand if the movie fails. There is also the open question of other merchandise tie-ins.\n",

    "* Investigate whether it has existing media brands that would fit well with a Sci-Fi film.\n",
