    "Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but they lack experience in this market. There are many difficult problems facing new studios entering the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid in this endeavor we will give recommendations to help address three core problems that any studio will have to answer in the course of making a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determining what type of project to pursue.\n",
    "* Determining what talent should be hired.\n",
    "* Determining the timeline of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help answer elements of these problems we will investigate the answers to three related questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What genre has had the high average profit in the past 20 years?\n",
    "* What directors have had the highest average return in that genre?\n",
    "* What month of the year is good to release a major film?\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking a genre is necessary to give an initial outline to the projects, and hiring a director is a good way of determining what other talent is appropriate since they can bring their expertise to help answer lower level talent decisions."

    "Based on this analysis Josh Whedon offers a good balance of high average return with more of a track record of success. He also has writing talent which is a bonus since your new studio will also need writers for the project. That said, Josh has had a number or recent scandals that might affect his effectiveness as a directon. Colin Trevorrow would be a reasonable choice if the recent scandals Josh has been involved in are too much of a risk to the brand, or hiring him is morally unacceptable to management."

    "Any analysis done with only this data will be inherently limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, the data only contains information about production budgets and not other expenses. For instance, if Sci-Fi films are adversized much more than other film, then that would cut into the profit that this analysis suggest they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also problems with inferring causal claims from this data. For example, if Hollywood expects that summer is more profitable, they will likely release their big tent poll films during that time, which will then also skew the data into suggeesting the summer is profitable. With just this data, it is difficult to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also numerous problems with making inferences from small samples, for example, many of the most profitable directors only made a couple of films, but it is not clear this will be very predictive of their success in new or different projects."

    "My stated recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Release a Sci-Fi film.\n",

    "This leaves many other issues unresolved. What script sould the movie use and should it be connected to other Microsoft media projects, which has potential rewards in increased sales in other areas such as video games, but also risks in damaging the brand if the movie fails. There is also the open question of other merchandise tie-ins.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest that Microsoft:\n",
    "* Do market research into what story types and themes are popular.\n",
    "* Investigate whether it has existing media brands that would fit well with a Sci-Fi film.\n",
    "* Investigate the Sci-Fi novel genre and see if any highly selling books would make for a good adaptation."
